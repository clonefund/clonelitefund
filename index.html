            <h2>Dividend Policy</h2>
            <p>At CLON Elite Fund, we are committed to maximizing shareholder value and maintaining a transparent relationship with our investors. Our dividend policy reflects this commitment by ensuring the full distribution of profits earned each year to our shareholders.<br>

Annual Dividend Payment: We distribute dividends once a year, with all accumulated profits for the year being returned to shareholders. This practice aligns with our goal to provide consistent and rewarding investment returns to those who trust in our management.<br>

Dividend Day: The designated day for dividend distribution is December 11th of each year, starting from 2024. This date was chosen to mark the end of our fiscal year and to streamline the financial planning for both the fund and our investors.<br>

Profit Calculation Period: Profits are calculated from the day of the fund's establishment until the dividend payout day. This period allows us to accurately measure the full financial performance of the fund over its fiscal year.<br>

Reset on Dividend Day: Dividend Day also serves as 'day zero' for calculating profits for the coming year. This reset ensures clarity in financial reporting and aligns our accounting practices with our strategic planning.<br>

This structured approach to dividends underscores our dedication to financial integrity and our strategy of sharing the success of the fund directly with our investors.
